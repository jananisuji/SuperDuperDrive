# Super*Duper*Drive Cloud Storage
You have to develop the Super*Duper*Drive project. This is just like the products like Google Drive and Dropbox. Here we not only develop the Feature of File Managemengt we also include a personal information management feature in our application and develop the minimum viable product includes with two user-facing features:

1. **Simple File Storage:** Upload/download/remove files
2. **Note Management:** Add/update/remove text notes

Super*Duper*Drive wants you to focus on building the web application with the skills you acquired in this course. That means you are responsible for developing the features of this website. 

## Starter Project
We built a starter project for you. This includes the basic structure of your projects. 

We already designed a database schema for the project and has added it to the `/schema` directory. That means you don't have to design the database, only develop the PHP code to interact with it. 

We also created some HTML templates from the design team's website mockups, and they placed them in the root folder. These are static pages right now, and you have to configure them with PHP to add functionality and real data from the server you develop. 

From the link above, you can download the starter code and open it as a PHP Project in Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements and Roadmap
We laid out a development roadmap with requirements and milestones. You need to implement the following pages:

1. Login page
 - Everyone should be allowed access to this page, and users can use this page to login to the application. 
 - Show login errors, like invalid username/password, on this page. 


2. Sign Up page
 - Everyone should be allowed access to this page, and potential users can use this page to sign up for a new account. 
 - Validate that the username supplied does not already exist in the application, and show such signup errors on the page when they arise.
 - Remember to store the user's password securely!


3. Home page
The home page is the center of the application and hosts the three required pieces of functionality. The existing template presents them as three tabs that can be clicked through by the user:


 i. Files
  - The user should be able to upload files and see any files they previously uploaded. 

  - The user should be able to view/download or delete previously-uploaded files.
  - Any errors related to file actions should be displayed. For example, a user should not be able to upload two files with the same name, but they'll never know unless you tell them!


 ii. Notes
  - The user should be able to create notes and see a list of the notes they have previously created.
  - The user should be able to edit or delete previously-created notes.

The home page should have a logout button that allows the user to logout of the application and keep their data private.

We good luck with the project!
